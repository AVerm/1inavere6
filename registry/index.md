**(
If you see this, we're still adding stuff to this!
If you had your heart set on getting something,
you can do whatever you want with the stuff on here,
but we might be adding more stuff later
)**

We are so fortunate to already have all the plates, towels, sheets, etc. that we need (and really nice versions of them!).
We also know that a lot of our guests are taking off work and spending money on plane tickets and hotels to attend the wedding.
It’s cliché to say “your presence is present enough”, but we truly mean that and do not expect anyone to get us anything.
However, if you really really want to get us something, you can check out the registry below.

Note: this will open in a new tab, so make sure to come back to this one for anything you were still working on.
