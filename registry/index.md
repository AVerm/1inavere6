(If you see this note, we're still working on the registry. Don't touch it!)

We are so fortunate to already have all the plates, towels, sheets, etc. that we need (and really nice versions of them!).
We also know that a lot of our guests are taking off work and spending money on plane tickets and hotels to attend the wedding.
It’s cliché to say “your presence is present enough”, but we truly mean that and do not expect anyone to get us anything.
However, if you really really want to get us something, you can check out the registry below.
