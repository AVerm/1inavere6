# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Is there parking at the venue?
: A: The venue does have a small parking lot as well as lots of
free street parking. However, if you want to relax and enjoy
yourself (and the open bar), it should be quick and easy to get
an Uber.



Q: What do I wear?
: A: The dress code is dressy cocktail hour, but you can check out
more on [our "What to Wear" page](/what2wear)!



Q: Are kids invited?
: A: Yes! When in doubt, your RSVP form should include the names of
everyone in your party who is invited. If you believe we have
made a mistake, let us know!



Q: Do I get a plus one?
: A: Your RSVP form should include the names of everyone in your
party who is invited. Unfortunately, we cannot add additional
people beyond that. If you believe we have made a mistake, let us
know.



Q: My name is wrong on my invite/RSVP form!
: A: Uh oh! We did our best to get everyone's names right, but
we're not always perfect. If your name is spelled wrong or you
prefer a different name, let us know here (form coming soon).



Q: What the heck is a "[1inavere6](1inavere6.com)"?
: A: There are two parts to this. The first is scientific
notation, specifically a format called ["E notation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation). A number that looks like "AeB" means "A and then B zeroes", and just "eB" means "1 and then B zeroes". That means "1inavere6" should instead say "1inaver1000000", which you might recognize as "1inavermillion", or a pun on "1 in a million" and "Vermillion", our soon-to-be last name.
