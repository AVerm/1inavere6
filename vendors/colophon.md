## Designer

Designed by Yuac's Alex Vermillion.

## Domain

Domain purchased on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).

Registered for 2 years for $19.16 plus a $0.18 ICANN fee.

Namecheap included "1 year of Free Domain Privacy", though they
always offer this for free.

## Hosting

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free as
part of a [public repository](https://github.com/AVerm/1inavere6).

The website is mostly a collection of Markdown files which are
automagically converted by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) into
HTML with the help of some SCSS (partly included in the service,
[partly handwritten](https://github.com/AVerm/1inavere6/tree/main/assets/css)).
There are also some [HTML templates](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAVerm%2F1inavere6++language%3AHTML&type=code).

GitHub pages has a free SSL (through [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) thrown in, which is why the
padlock next to the address bar is green and happy, not red and
scary.
This is a pretty cool feature.

## Typefaces

When making a website, it's important to remember that fonts cost
money.
A lot of fonts will offer samples for non-commercial use.
We used 3 of these:

- [Tenar Black Serif](https://befonts.com/tenar-black-serif-font.html): The loopy fun one at the very top in the navigation bar
- [Pangea Afrikan](https://befonts.com/pangea-afrikan-font-family.html): A nice "Segoe UI Black"-like that is supposedly optimized for African charactersets (notice the ["ƙ"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C6%98), a largely [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_language) letter so far as I know, in the display image for the font)
- [Sanchez
  Niu](https://befonts.com/sanchez-niu-font-family.html): A
  pleasant and clean "Rockwell"-like

## Images
