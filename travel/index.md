## Getting There

If you’re from out of state, the best airport to fly into is Chicago O’Hare Internation Airport (ORD).
We suggest getting to the airport nice and early for your return flight, but if you find yourself with extra time inside we recommend looking for a Nuts on Clark (Alex's favorite place to buy malt balls).

## Getting Around

Whether or not to rent a car probably depends on how much you want to do and where you want to go.
If you’re going straight from the airport to your hotel and staying close to there, then you may want to just Uber/Lyft.
There is parking at the venue but parking at hotels and other places in the city may be hard to find or expensive.

In downtown Chicago it should be quick and easy to get an Uber/Lyft and then you can relax and enjoy at the reception without worrying about driving home.
However, if you plan to stay longer and check out more distant places, then you will probably want a car.

## Getting Rest

We currently have a hotel block available at the Hyatt House Chicago / West Loop – Fulton Market, which is about a 6-8 minute drive from the venue.
There are many hotels, restaurants, and shops right around there in the “Fulton Market” area.
To book a room in the block, [use this booking link](https://www.hyatt.com/shop/chixl?location=Hyatt%20House%20Chicago%20%2F%20West%20Loop-Fulton%20Market&checkinDate=2023-11-04&checkoutDate=2023-11-06&rooms=1&adults=1&kids=0&corp_id=g-anve#room-page-anchor) or use code G-ANVE.
If you would like to book a room but the block is full, or you have any other issues, please contact us right away ([oneinavere6@gmail.com](mailto:oneinavere6@gmail.com) or [602-361-1203](tel:6023611203)).
We also recommend the Hoxton as another option, but we do not have a special block there.
